/**
 * A listener is notified about events that happen in an environment. This
 * environment is usually an object or a group of objects that acts as an
 * event source. In most cases a listener listens to lifecycle events of an
 * object, property changes of an object or receives notifications about
 * operations which an object performs.
 * 
 * <p>Listeners are registered to resources which handle the actual
 * listener registration to the event sources. Resources also support
 * listener unregistration as well as contain some other useful utilities
 * for specific listener type.
 * 
 * <p>Listeners should be implemented as singletons or classes with controlled
 * instance creation. Such listener implementations then ease the implementing
 * of a listener provider which must always return the same listener instance
 * for specified listener implementation class. This singleton like behavior of
 * listeners is strictly recommended as it is fully compatible and works very
 * well with the default core implementation. Listener implementations with
 * a single parameterless constructor are also supported but not recommended
 * as the singleton like behavior can be easily broken in this case. See the
 * documentation of {@link DefaultListeners#getDefaultListenerProvider()} for
 * more details about supported singleton forms.
 * 
 * <p>Listeners are considered equal by their implementing classes. In
 * other words it means that as long as they are implemented as singletons,
 * reference equivalence between listeners is in general the same as
 * {@link #equals(Object)} equivalence. This property of listeners is
 * essential and must be preserved by all implementations in order to work
 * property when used with the core facilities.
